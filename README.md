## Hello!👋
I'm Dan, a student at the University Of Waterloo studying Computer Engineering.

I do my best to either practice coding or build cool projects. Currently learning about full-stack development
through _The Odin Project_. I'm also looking to dive into hardware projects with the ESP32 or STM32 which _hopefully_
turns out well. 

Programming Languages:
- C++
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

Check out some of the pinned projects which I am most happy with! My favourite is the 
custom web server built in C to host my own messaging app found in [here](https://github.com/GitWorkingTime/CSE-FP-CS30-V2)
